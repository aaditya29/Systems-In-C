# Database Server in C

A **database server** is a server that uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or computers. It is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing database services and data.

## Key Features

- **Data Storage**: Stores data in a structured format.
- **Data Retrieval**: Allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data.
- **Data Management**: Provides tools for managing data, including backup, recovery, and security.

## Project Description

Here we are going to design and code a fast in-memory database server. We will use knowledge of structs, linked lists, pointers and function pointers as well as linear searches, performance measuring, binary trees and hyper-optimized hash tables.
