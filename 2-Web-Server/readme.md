# Web Servers

A web server is a system that delivers content or services to end users over the internet. It processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.

## How Web Servers Work

1. **Client Request**: A user sends a request to the web server through a web browser by entering a URL or clicking a link.
2. **DNS Resolution**: The browser contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
3. **Server Response**: The web server receives the request and processes it. This may involve fetching data from a database, executing server-side scripts, or retrieving static files.
4. **Content Delivery**: The server sends the requested content back to the user's browser, which then renders the page.

## Key Components

- **Hardware**: Physical server machines that store web server software and website data.
- **Software**: Web server software like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS that handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS protocols used for communication between the client and server.
