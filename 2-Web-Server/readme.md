# Web Servers

A web server is a system that delivers content or services to end users over the internet. It processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.

## How Web Servers Work

1. **Client Request**: A user sends a request to the web server through a web browser by entering a URL or clicking a link.
2. **DNS Resolution**: The browser contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
3. **Server Response**: The web server receives the request and processes it. This may involve fetching data from a database, executing server-side scripts, or retrieving static files.
4. **Content Delivery**: The server sends the requested content back to the user's browser, which then renders the page.

## Key Components

- **Hardware**: Physical server machines that store web server software and website data.
- **Software**: Web server software like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS that handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS protocols used for communication between the client and server.

## Building a Web Server in C

To build a simple web server in C, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C programming
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts

### Steps

1. **Setup the Environment**:

   - Install a C compiler like GCC.
   - Create a new directory for your project.

2. **Create the Server Code**:

   - Create a new C file.
   - Include necessary headers.

3. **Initialize the Server**:

   - Define constants and variables.

4. **Create and Bind the Socket**:

   - Create a socket and bind it to the specified port.

5. **Listen for Connections**:

   - Start listening for incoming connections.

6. **Accept and Handle Requests**:

   - Accept incoming connections and handle requests.

7. **Compile and Run**:
   - Compile the server code.
   - Run the server.
